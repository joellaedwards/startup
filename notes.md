## AWS

SSH in: ssh -i C:\Users\joell\OneDrive\Desktop\260keypair.pem ubuntu@44.217.195.141

My IP address is: 44.217.195.141
Launching my AMI I initially put it on a private subnet. Even though it had a public IP address and the security group was right, I wasn't able to connect to it.

## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the [instruction](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md).

## HTML

This was easy. I was careful to use the correct structural elements such as header, footer, main, nav, and form. The links between the three views work great using the `a` element.

The part I didn't like was the duplication of the header and footer code. This is messy, but it will get cleaned up when I get to React.

## CSS

This took a couple hours to get it how I wanted. It was important to make it responsive and Bootstrap helped with that. It looks great on all kinds of screen sizes.

Bootstrap seems a bit like magic. It styles things nicely, but is very opinionated. You either do, or you do not. There doesn't seem to be much in between.

I did like the navbar it made it super easy to build a responsive header.

```html
      <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg bg-body-tertiary">
        <div class="container-fluid">
          <a class="navbar-brand">
            <img src="logo.svg" width="30" height="30" class="d-inline-block align-top" alt="" />
            Calmer
          </a>
          <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarSupportedContent">
            <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
          </button>
          <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
            <ul class="navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0">
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link active" href="play.html">Play</a>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="about.html">About</a>
              </li>
              <li class="nav-item">
                <a class="nav-link" href="index.html">Logout</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </nav>
    </header>
```

I also used SVG to make the icon and logo for the app. This turned out to be a piece of cake.

```html
<svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect width="100" height="100" fill="#0066aa" rx="10" ry="10" />
  <text x="50%" y="50%" dominant-baseline="central" text-anchor="middle" font-size="72" font-family="Arial" fill="white">C</text>
</svg>
```

## React Part 1: Routing

Setting up Vite and React was pretty simple. I had a bit of trouble because of conflicting CSS. This isn't as straight forward as you would find with Svelte or Vue, but I made it work in the end. If there was a ton of CSS it would be a real problem. It sure was nice to have the code structured in a more usable way.

## React Part 2: Reactivity

This was a lot of fun to see it all come together. I had to keep remembering to use React state instead of just manipulating the DOM directly.

Handling the toggling of the checkboxes was particularly interesting.

```jsx
<div className="input-group sound-button-container">
  {calmSoundTypes.map((sound, index) => (
    <div key={index} className="form-check form-switch">
      <input
        className="form-check-input"
        type="checkbox"
        value={sound}
        id={sound}
        onChange={() => togglePlay(sound)}
        checked={selectedSounds.includes(sound)}
      ></input>
      <label className="form-check-label" htmlFor={sound}>
        {sound}
      </label>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
```




## üß© SECTION 1: HTML BASICS

### 1. What does the `<link>` element do?

‚úÖ **Summary:**  
The `<link>` element connects external resources (like stylesheets or icons) to an HTML document.

üí° **Example:**
``html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">``
goes inside the head. does not display anything on the page.

### 2. What does a `<div>` tag do?
Division groups elemments into a block for styling or layout. 
``<div class="container">
<p>Hello World</p>
</div>``
often paired with CSS classes or IDs

### 3. Opening tags for key HTML elements
<p> paragraph. block of text
<ol> ordered list. numbered list
<ul> unordered list bulleted

### 4. Declaring doc type
```<!DOCTYPE html>```
always at the top of HTML doc

### 5. displaying image with hyperlink
`` <a href="https://byu.edu">
 <img src="cougar.png" alt="BYU logo">
</a>``

### 6. Difference between #title and .grid
- #title selects element by ID. just one thing
- .grid selects element by class. reusable mult things in same class
(in css)

### 7. Padding vs margin
- padding = space inside the element (between content and border)
- margin = space outside element (between border and neighbor)
+-----------------------------+
|         Margin              |
|   +---------------------+   |
|   |      Border         |   |
|   |  +-------------+    |   |
|   |  |  Padding    |    |   |
|   |  |  Content    |    |   |

### 9. change all divs to red

div {
  background-color: red;
}

### 10. trouble text to green 
```<p>double <span id="trouble">trouble</span></p>```
CSS:
#trouble {
  color: green;
}

<p>double <span style="color: green;">trouble</span></p>


<p id="byu">BYU Rocks!</p>

<script>
document.getElementById("byu").style.color = "green";
</script>





### 11. Default display of span is inline. don't start on a newline and only take as much space as needed

### 12. flexbox image layout
.container {
  display: flex;
}
- children (e.g. images) appear side by side horizontally 
- can control direction with flex-direction and spacing with justify-content

# 13. padding CSS
div {
  padding: 10px 20px 5px 15 px;
}
top, right, bottom, left (clockwise)

### 14. Arrow function syntax
const add = (x, y) => x + y;
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
- shorter syntax. dont bind tier own this. great for callbacks and array methods

### 15. Using map() on arrays
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = nums.map(n => n * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6]
- creates new array by applying a function to each element

### 16. Using getElementById and addEventListener
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
});
- select elements by id, attaches an event (like click) and runs the function

### 17. using a # selector in JS.
document.querySelector("#title");
- works like CSS -- # = id, . = class, element name = tag selector

### 18. selecting and syling with JS

document.getElementById("byu").style.color = "green";

### 19. changing text in JS
HTML:
<p id="animal">fish</p>
JS:
document.getElementById("animal").innerText = "crow";

### JS control syntax:
if (x > 5) { ... } else { ... }
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { ... }
while (x < 10) { ... }
switch(day) {
  case 'Mon': ...
}


switch (day) {
  case "Mon":
    console.log("Start of week");
    break;
  case "Fri":
    console.log("Weekend!");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Midweek");
}




### 21. JS objects
const person = {
  name: "Joella",
  age: 21
};
person.job = "developer";
- objects are dynamic. can add or modify keys

### 22. Including JS in html
<script src="script.js"></script>
place before </body> so html loads first

### 23. javascript for loop 
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

### 24. promises
Promise.resolve("hi").then(msg => console.log(msg));
- promises handle ansynchronous code -- then() runs after resolution

üåê SECTION 4: DOM (Document Object Model)

‚úÖ The DOM represents the HTML page as a tree of objects that JS can manipulate.

üí° True statements about the DOM:

It lets JS access and modify HTML/CSS.

Each element is a node.

You can add, remove, or edit elements dynamically.
